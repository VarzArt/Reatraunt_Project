## 4. Technical component 

The project is written using this technology stack:
- HTML;
- CSS (and the preprocessor SCSS);
- JavaScript.

The service contains a huge amount of both primitive and complex animation, implemented both with transition and using @keyframes. Also, the design of this project was developed completely from scratch and implemented using both common and not quite popular practices of CSS and SCSS.

The JS is responsible for the logic of the project and it is applied throughout the code in the form of:

- Synchronous code;
- Asynchronous code;
- Micro and macro tasks;
- Interactions with HTML...

And in many other aspects of the project
